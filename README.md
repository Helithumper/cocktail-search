# COCKTAIL SEARCH

This program will take in a list of cocktail ingredients then find you some cocktails that you can make with those ingredients.

## Development Goals

I want to do the following with this project

1. Use Docker to containerize the whole project
2. Use Travis CI or some other CI solution to make continuous integration from git reasonable.
3. Learn to use NodeJS for the site
4. Create linked MySQL tables to store the data in an expandable and useful way

## Note on Sources

In this project I will compile lists of cocktails from sources that aren't mine. This project is entirely so that I can learn to use many tools. The sources of data aren't mine. I will list them here in this list if you want to go support the creators of the data sources!
